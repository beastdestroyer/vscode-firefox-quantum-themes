# Test Files

These files are not meant to be ran on your computer, but rather opened in VSCode to perform syntax highlighting tests for the various languages. Within each of these languages resides (many) operations that can be done in that language (and verified to work).

For usage, simply type `code .` or `code-insiders .` inside the test files directory, enable this theme and check.
