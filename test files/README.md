# Test Files

These files are not meant to be ran on your computer, but rather opened in VSCode to perform syntax highlighting tests for the various languages. Within each of these languages resides (many) operations that can be done in that language (and verified to work). As I obviously don't work in all these languages, I have just taken snippets and copied them from google searches. If you wish to add or editthjese test files to show the full capabilities, then by all means go ahead!
