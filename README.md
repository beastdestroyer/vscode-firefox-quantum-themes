# Firefox Quantum Themes

This theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is inspired by the colours used in Firefox Quantum's DevTools. This theme is Open-Source and anyone is welcome to submit PRs, open issues etc. I would love to hear your feedback! Look below for more information.

## Alpha Screenshots
I'm always changing many colours and as such, these are not representative of the final product. I have currently not released this either. If you wish to get yourself a preview, please let me know!

## Thank You's!
This theme was heavily inspired by Firefox DevTools, as well as the [One Dark Pro Port](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) and VSCode itself! Thanks to them all for the ideas :)
