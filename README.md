## Contribution

I currently work on this theme in my spare time. As of writing, it is available in the Marketplace. As a new developer, I am still attempting to work things out, thanks!

If editing and wanting to submit a pull request, please ensure that as much sufficient detail is provided, and briefly state your changes and why, or if meant to fix an issue, reference the problem alongside it.

## Thank You's!

This theme was heavily inspired by Firefox DevTools, as well as the [One Dark Pro Port](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) and VSCode itself! Thanks to them all for the ideas :)
