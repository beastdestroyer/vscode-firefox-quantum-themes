# Firefox Quantum Themes

This theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is inspired by the colours used in Firefox Quantum's DevTools. This theme is Open-Source and anyone is welcome to submit PRs, open issues etc. I would love to hear your feedback! Look below for more information.

I would also like to emphasize that this is NOT an exact replica, as the DevTools and Scratchpad are so inconsistently coloured, and they are sometimes hard to differentiate in terms of colour. I would like to say that I have attempted to stick to the original styling but swapped around a few colours for readability.

Currently, only the Dark Theme is available.

## Screenshots

Please note: I work on this in my spare time, and I balance this among other projects too. Please don't be so hasty. These screenshots are not representative of the final product.

## CHANGELOG

I as a person always like to maintain 2 separate changelogs, one for original releases and one for preview/beta releases

BETA Release Changelog: [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/beastdestroyer/vscode-firefox-quantum-themes/blob/master/CHANGELOG%20B.md)

## Theme Colours

For the colours used, please refer to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors)

## Contribution

I currently work on this theme in my spare time. As of writing, it currently isn't available on the Marketplace, but you may use it by first cloning the repo and sticking it in the `~/.vscode/extensions` folder

That allows you to see and use directly. If editing and wanting to submit a pull request, please ensure that as much sufficient detail is provided, and briefly state your changes and why, or if meant to fix an issue, reference the problem alongside it.

## Thank You's!

This theme was heavily inspired by Firefox DevTools, as well as the [One Dark Pro Port](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) and VSCode itself! Thanks to them all for the ideas :)
